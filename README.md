# Automatic integrations test with Wildfly
This project shows how to do integration tests on a Wildfly (http://www.wildfly.org/) application server.
Using the wildfly-maven-plugin (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.wildfly.plugins/wildfly-maven-plugin) it will automatically start, deploy and stop the server during the integration tests.
